# Indivisible Somerville

Welcome to the Indivisible Somerville Github! This repo contains the theme for our main website, which runs on open-source blogging platform [Ghost](https://ghost.org/). The repo is linked to our staging site http://104.131.108.130/. (We will have commits to master automatically go to the server and trigger a Ghost restart - this isn't done yet). 

To commit to the repo, please fork it and work on a feature branch. We will set up a guide on how to test Ghost locally to help you test changes. When you're ready, submit a pull request. 

To get started hacking on Ghost themes, check out the themes intro: http://www.freshtechtips.com/2014/04/create-custom-ghost-theme.html

## Wishlist

The issues tab contains a wish list of small features we'd like to have. Some are changes to the code in this repo, some are standalone projects. Feel free to start working on those at any time.
